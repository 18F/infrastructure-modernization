# Goals

To create a list of candidate applications and bucket those applications into the Alpha and Beta phases of the migration to the cloud.


# Process

*  Get list of applications from partner agency (see below)
*  Ask any questions of the application (based on the list you receive)
* Prune the list based on technology and security (rule out any applications where you can't get support the FISMA level).
* Bucket the list into the Alpha and Beta phases.

# List of Candidate Applications

 The list of candidate applications to move to the cloud should include:

* application name
* application description
* software stack
* number of users
* cost
* status of the application (in development, in production etc.)
* FISMA rating

## Deliverables

A list of the candidate applications, sorted into two buckets: Alpha and Beta. The applications in the Alpha list are those that will be considered for migration first.
