Deploy
In this stage, the entire cross-functional team will work together to deploy the Alpha applications into the cloud.

Goal

Deploy the Alpha applications into the cloud.

Process

Create a backlog of stories to migrate an application into the cloud. Do this in the beginning, but then do a backlog grooming periodically.

The migration will happen in sprints, and the work will be done through focused workshops.

Workshops

All members of the cross-functional team attend all workshops. Each workshop is split into a general education piece, followed by specific tasks to migrate the application into the cloud.
